        <p>I have a super cute dog. She's a Boston Terrier/ French Bulldog mix who is alsmot 9 years old, named Bailie. With what little free time I have between school and work I usually spend it playing video games, on facetime with my sister, or both.</p>

        <p>I used to have another dog. Her name was Kaia, and she was a Boxer. she was the sweetest chillest dog ever. She was a great cuddler, absolutely loved food and loved chasing after a red laser dot.</p>
